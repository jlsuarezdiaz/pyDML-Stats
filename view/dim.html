<h3>Dimensionality Ρeduction Εxperiments.</h3>

<p>Here you can see the results of dimensionality reduction experiments, using as metrics the 3-NN, 5-NN and 7-NN scores. Algorithms are tested at dimensions 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, the number of classes of the dataset - 1 and the maximum dimension of the dataset. Notice that LDA only can learn projections onto dimensions lower than the number of classes of the dataset. You can also observe the progressions with the line charts.</p>
