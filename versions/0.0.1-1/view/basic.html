<h3>Basic Experiments</h3>

<p>Here you can see the results of all the distance learning algorithms at maximum dimension, except the centroid and kernel-based algorithms, which are evaluated in their corresponding sections, and the algorithms that only can learn a euclidean distance at maximum dimension, like PCA or ANMM. The algorithms are evaluated with 3-NN, 5-NN and 7-NN classifiers. In the cells with (-) the algorithm didn't converge.</p>
