<h3>Nearest Centroid Experiments</h3>

<p>Here you can see the results of the distance metric learning algorithms oriented to nearest centroid classification. Each of these distance metric learning algorithms is evaluated with its corresponding classifier (NCMML / NCMC (k ctrd)) for 1, 2 and 3 centroids. The results are compared with the scores of the same classifiers using euclidean distance (Euclidean + CLF).</p>
